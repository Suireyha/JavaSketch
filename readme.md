# A simple pixel art project in Java
I'm remaking my project OdinSketch from 2022 in Java using Javax.swing
## To do
- Add support for the mouseDown listener instead of using buttons
- ~~Paint with the selected colour variable that can be changed via the colour picker~~
- ~~Add colour picker~~
- Add an erase mode
- ~~Add a clear button~~
- Add a rainbow brush
- ~~Create a rounded cricle button in the btn.java file~~
- Add smooth gradient animation for hover and selected buttons
- Add glow effect for buttons
- Selecting eraser, rainbow or brush should unselect other brush types
- ~~Make the buttons text not get selected when clicked and center the text to the buttons properly~~
- ~~Change font and potentially colour of the button labels~~
- Each button should potentially just be a new class that extends btn so we can just override features to add the unique stuff
